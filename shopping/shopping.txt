Line 1 calls a method called document.addEventListener which has two parameters
'DOMContentLoaded' and the function (event), it means when the global page (DOM)
is being loaded take the parameter called function.


Line 2 creates a variable called inputBox which has a value with a method type called
get Element by id, it has only one parameter that we declare it inside the string.


Line 3 creates a variable called listItem which has a value with a method type called
document.querySelector (querySelector goes and take directly take the Element which we are
putting inside the string, that means we don't need to give an id for our Element
in this case), it has only one parameter that we declare it inside the string.


Line 4 same as Line 3


Line 5 we have a variable called addItemButton which we call with a method that contains
two parameters ('click' and function (event)).


Line 6 we use the if expression or statement which we give a specific condition for calling
a method, it means (whenever our inputBox.value which includes also the .trim()
is not equal to '' (empty sting) go and call following method or functions)


Line 7 we are appending the function called creatNewListItem which creates us the
li element which contains the span and button elements
to our variable called listItem.


Line 8 we put the empty string ('') as the value for our variable called inputBox.


Line 9 we activate the disable status(attribute) for our variable called
addItemButton('button')
by giving the value true.

Line 10 we close our if statement by putting the right curly bracket.


Line 11 we call the method focus for our variable called inputBox.


Line 12 we close the function by curly bracket and closing the method (add.EventListener)
with parentheses and semicolon.


Line 14 we have a variable called inputBox which we call with a method (addEventListener)
that contains two parameters ('keyup' and function (event)).


Line 15 = Line 6
ATTENTION! If javascript read our value inside the parenthesis as a true value then it will
run our if statement otherwise it will jump up over our if expression.


Line 16 = Line 9

Line 17 we declare another if expression which means if the value for our property called
event.key is going to be equal to the string ('Enter') go and run the if statement.


Line 18 = Line 7


Line 19 = Line 8


Line 20 the if expression which is opened on line 17 is now closed.


Line 21 the if expression which is opened on line 15 is now closed.


Line 22 = Line 6 but only if the value is equal to ''(empty string).


Line 23 = Line 9


Line 24 the if expression which is opened on line 22 is now closed.


Line 25 = Line 14


Line 29 = Line 12


Line 27 we close the function by curly bracket and closing the method (add.EventListener)
with parentheses and semicolon which took place on the first code line.


Line 31 we declare our function called createNewListItem which contains one parameter
called itemText


Line 33, 34, 38 we create 3 variables which create elements called (li, span and button).


Line 34, 38 we create values for our span and button elements.


Line 40 = Line 5 (used only for a different variable)


Line 41 is Outputs a message to the Web Console that modify, whenever a function is being
called before our console.log it shows up the message(the value as a parameter for our
console.log) on our web console.


Line 42 we are gonna add the method .remove() to our variable called listItem.


Line 48 closed the function from line 31.


From line 44 to 45 using the method .appendChild() to add the elements or text inside elements.


Line 47 whenever javascript reach this point that shows up something like return list;
it means go back and read the code on line 31 which is an element called li.


Line 48 closed the function called createNewListItem Line 31.
